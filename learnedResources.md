    * Important HTML tags for SEO [link](https://www.socialmediatoday.com/news/8-of-the-most-important-html-tags-for-seo/574987/)
        * 1. Title tag: Title tags are used to set up those clickable headlines that you see in the SERP:
            < title> bla bla bla bla bla</ title>
        * 2. Meta description tag: Meta description tags are used to set up descriptions within search result snippets
            < meta name="description" content=" bla bla bla bla bla bla bla bla">
        * 3. Heading (H1-H6) tags: Heading tags are used to structure your pages for both the reader and search engines
            * Don’t use more than one H1 - H1 heading stands apart from other headings because it’s treated by search engines as the title of the page. Not to be confused with the title tag - the title tag is displayed in search results, while the H1 tag is displayed on your website.​
            * Maintain shallow structure - There’s rarely a need to go below H3. Use H1 for the title, H2 for section headings, and H3 for subsections. Anything more tends to get confusing.​
            * Form query-like headings - Treat each heading as an additional opportunity to rank in search. To this end, each heading should sound either like a query or an answer to a query - keywords included.
            * Be consistent with all headings - All of your headings should be written in such a way that if you were to remove all the text and keep only the headings, they would read like a list.
        * 4. Image alt text: While the main goal of alt text is web accessibility, the SEO goal of the alt attribute is image indexing.
            * alt text tags : < img alt='bla bla bla '>
            * From an SEO perspective, alt text is a big part of how images are indexed in Google search. So if there is a visual component to what you do - be it the images of your products, your work, your stock images, your art - then you should definitely consider using image alt texts.
        * 5. Schema markup: Schema markup is used to enhance regular SERP snippets with rich snippet features:
            * The only best practice is to visit schema.org and see whether they’ve got any tags that can be applied to your types of pages.
            < span property="propertyNameOrTypeYouWnt">....</ span>
        * 6. HTML5 semantic tags: HTML5 elements are used for better descriptions of various page components:
            * article - isolates a post from the rest of the code, makes it portable
            * section - isolates a group of posts within a blog or a group of headings within a post
            * aside - isolates supplementary content that is not part of the main content
            * header - isolates the top part of the document, article, section, may contain navigation
            * footer - isolates the bottom of the document, article, section, contains meta information
            * nav - isolates navigation menus, groups of navigational elements
        * 7. Meta robots tag: Robots meta tag is all about the rules of engagement between the websites and the search engines.
            * Best practices: Meta robots tag should be placed in the head section of the page code, and it should specify which crawlers it addresses and which instructions should be applied:
            * Below are some of the parameters most commonly used with robots meta tags. You can use any number of them in a single meta robots tag, separated by a comma:
                * noindex — page should not be indexed
                * nofollow — links on the page should not be followed
                * follow — links on the page should be followed, even if the page is not to be indexed
                * noimageindex — images on the page should not be indexed
                * noarchive — search results should not show a cached version of the page
                * unavailable_after — page should not be indexed beyond a certain date.
        * 8. Canonical tag: Canonical tag spares you from the risk of duplicate content:
        * Best practices: To avoid potential SEO complications, apply the canonical tag to the following pages:
            * Pages available via different URLs
            * Pages with very similar content
            * Dynamic pages that create their own URL parameters

    * API REST
