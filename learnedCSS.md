* Online courses, challenges and creation of my own projects.

## What I learned/used 
### CSS 
* Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) 
    * grid
        * grid-template-columns: -> creates the qtd of columns
            * grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr);
        * grid-column: -> select the columns an element is going to take.
            * 1 / span 2 -> takes the space 1 and 2 (1fr). count the space.
            * 1 / 3 -> same as above. takes the space 1 and 2 (1fr). Counts the lines. start line one and a=ends line 3.
            * grid-column: span 3; -> this start in the available line. is the same as 3 / span 3. -> it is going to take 3 spaces.


            
    * nth-child()
